This is a portfolio project for Codecademy. 
The premise of the project was about creating a recommendation program that would recommend the user something.
In this project, I tried to sort the items in the list by multiple variables included in the "Game" class. 
The particular variable being used to sort through the list and append to the list of recommended games is dependant on the user's input.
All of the methods to sort through the list of games is the same, except for a small difference in searching by "Keyword".
The main difference is that it compares the first 4 characters of the word and compares it to the first 4 characters in each game's title.
I did it this way in order to recommend other games that might be similar. (For example, Star Wars and Star Fox would be recommended together with "Star")
While the algorithms for each search type is really simple and would not be optimal for a list of 100s of games, it works fine for this example.
